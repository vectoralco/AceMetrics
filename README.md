# AceMetrics

Consistent serves on the right targets helps you strengthen your tennis game. AceMetrics makes your practice more effective with its analysis on your serve placements.

During service practice sessions, players can plan to hit the six different zone targets with their serves. Tracking their placement outcomes and making the required changes will make the service practice more effective. AceMetrics helps players to track their serve placements in each zone. The graphs and charts indicate the strengths and weaknesses in the first and second serves on the target zones. It also helps players to plan their practice session and work on specific targets.

These are the app features which help players, coaches and parents to help improve players' serves,
	1. Multiple player profiles can be maintained
	2. Service practice session of each player can be logged and tracked
	3. During practice, the graphs and charts indicate the distribution of serves across zones and the outcome
